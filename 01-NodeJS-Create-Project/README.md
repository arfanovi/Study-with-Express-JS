Express.js is installed using Node Package Manager (npm) which comes bundled with Node.js. So, to install Express.js, you'll need Node.js installed first


Steps

    Check for Node.js:
    Open your terminal and type:
    Bash/ Terminal / node
    => node -v



    Create a project directory:
    Use your terminal to navigate to your desired project directory and create one:
    Bash/ Terminal / node
    => mkdir my-express-app
    => cd my-express-app


    Initialize project (optional):
    This step creates a package.json file that stores project dependencies. You can skip this if you don't need it:
    Bash/ Terminal / node
    npm init -y


    Install Express.js:
    Now, install Express.js using npm:
    Bash/ Terminal / node
    => npm install express --save



    index.js----
    The "start": "node index.js" script in a package.json file is commonly used in Node.js projects to define a standard way to start the application.
